# Weak join / correlation

The [`weak_join`](../engine/reference.md#weak_join) middleware correlates messages by a metadata
key and emits them as one joined message. **Input only.** It has two modes.

## Count mode

Wait for any N messages sharing a correlation key, then emit them as a JSON array:

```yaml
input:
  middlewares:
    - weak_join: { group_by: "correlation_id", expected_count: 3, timeout_ms: 5000 }
  kafka: { topic: "fragments", url: "localhost:9092" }
```

## Branch mode

Set `branch_by` to wait for **named** branches (e.g. one message from `inventory` and one from
`pricing`), then emit a branch-keyed JSON object. `required` overrides `expected_count`:

```yaml
- weak_join:
    group_by: "correlation_id"
    expected_count: 2
    timeout_ms: 5000
    branch_by: "source"
    required: ["inventory", "pricing"]
    on_timeout: discard
```

From the `copy` CLI, object/array fields take a JSON literal:

```bash
--from '...|weak-join?group_by=cid&expected_count=2&timeout_ms=1000&required=["inventory","pricing"]'
```

## On timeout

An incomplete group is either emitted partially (`on_timeout: fire`, the default) or dropped
(`on_timeout: discard`).

> **Acknowledgement.** By default (`ack: on_join`) a buffered message is acknowledged only
> once the joined message is committed, so a crash before the group completes redelivers its
> members. The source must allow that many unacknowledged messages: with a prefetch limit
> (e.g. AMQP `prefetch_count`) a group can stall until its timeout. `ack: on_receive`
> acknowledges on receipt instead and **loses the buffered members** on a crash.
