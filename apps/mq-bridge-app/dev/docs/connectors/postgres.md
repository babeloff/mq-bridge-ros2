# PostgreSQL / MySQL / MariaDB / SQLite

The `sqlx` connector reads and writes rows in a relational database table.
The same connector backs all four schemes — the URL scheme just selects the
driver. Postgres additionally has a dedicated [CDC connector](#postgresql-cdc)
for streaming change data instead of table reads.

## URL format

```text
postgres://[user:pass@]host[:port]/database?table=<name>
```

The scheme (`postgres`/`postgresql`, `mysql`, `mariadb`, `sqlite`) and
everything up to the query string is passed straight through as the driver
connection string; `table` (and any other recognised field below) is pulled
out of the query string into config. For SQLite, `host`/`database` are
replaced by a file path, e.g. `sqlite:///var/data/app.db?table=orders`.

## Config (YAML / library)

The same settings as a route endpoint in a config file, or in `Route.from_config` /
`fromConfig`. Every URL query parameter is a field of the same name under `sqlx:`.

```yaml
input:
  sqlx: { url: "postgres://user:pass@localhost/app", table: "orders", cursor_column: "id" }
```

The config key is `sqlx` for PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and SQLite; the connection string is the `url`.

## Examples

**Full-table read (source), one-shot:**

```bash
mqb copy --drain \
  --from 'postgres://user:pass@localhost/app?table=orders&cursor_column=id' \
  --to null:
```

`cursor_column` names a unique, increasing column to read in order. Without it the source
treats the table as an mq-bridge work queue, which needs `id` and `locked_until` columns.

**Write with auto-created table (destination):**

```bash
mqb copy --drain \
  --from file:///data/orders.csv?format=csv \
  --to 'postgres://user:pass@localhost/app?table=orders&auto_create_table=true'
```

**Resumable incremental read, keyed by a monotonic column, continuous:**

```bash
mqb copy \
  --from 'postgres://user:pass@localhost/app?table=orders&cursor_column=id&cursor_id=orders_export' \
  --to kafka://kafka.local:9092?topic=orders
```

Each restart resumes from the last `id` seen (persisted via `cursor_id`)
instead of re-copying from the start.

**Table to table, or file to table, by column name:**

```bash
mqb copy --drain \
  --from 'postgres://user:pass@src/app?table=orders&cursor_column=id' \
  --to 'postgres://user:pass@dst/app?table=orders&columns=auto&key=id'

mqb copy --drain \
  --from 'file://orders.csv?format=csv' \
  --to 'sqlite://app.db?table=orders&columns=auto&key=id'
```

`columns=auto` writes each top-level field of a record into the column of the same name; the
table must exist. `key=id` makes a rerun update the rows instead of failing on the duplicate
key. See [Writing by column name](#writing-by-column-name).

**Custom multi-column insert, MySQL:**

```bash
mqb copy --drain \
  --from postgres://user:pass@src/app?table=orders \
  --to 'mysql://user:pass@dst/app?table=orders&insert_query=INSERT+INTO+orders+%28id%2C+sku%2C+qty%29+VALUES+%28%24%7Bpayload%3Aid%7D%2C+%24%7Bpayload%3Asku%7D%2C+%24%7Bpayload%3Aqty%7D%29'
```

(`insert_query` is shown URL-encoded above — the SQL is
`INSERT INTO orders (id, sku, qty) VALUES (${payload:id}, ${payload:sku}, ${payload:qty})`.)

## Key options

| Option | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `table` | **Required.** Table to read from / write to. |
| `cursor_column` + `cursor_id` | Non-destructive, resumable incremental reads instead of a one-shot full-table copy. |
| `checkpoint_store` | (Consumer, `cursor_column` mode) Where to persist the resume cursor. Absent → a `mqb_cursors_<table>` table in the **source** database; a bare name reuses the source datastore with that table; a URL (`file://`, `postgres://`, `mysql://`, `mongodb://`, `s3://`/`gs://`/`az://`/`abfs://`) selects an external backend. Treated as a secret since it may embed credentials. |
| `timestamps` | (Consumer, `cursor_column` mode) `text` (default) renders `timestamptz` as Postgres prints it, `2026-10-04 09:15:23.923277+00`. `rfc3339` renders it in UTC as `2026-10-04T09:15:23.923277Z`, which other systems parse; a `timestamp` without zone gets the `T` but no offset. |
| `auto_create_table` | Publisher creates the destination table if missing. |
| `columns` | (Publisher) `auto` writes each JSON field into the table column of the same name. The table must exist. |
| `key` | (Publisher, with `columns`) Key column(s), comma-separated. A row with the same key is updated; needs a `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` on them. |
| `extra_column` | (Publisher, with `columns`) Column that takes the fields without a column of their own, as one JSON object (`jsonb`, `json` or text). |
| `insert_query` | Custom INSERT with `${payload:field}` / `${metadata:key}` tokens for multi-column writes. |
| `bulk_copy` | PostgreSQL only — use `COPY FROM STDIN` for high-throughput bulk loads. |
| `delete_after_read` | Consumer deletes rows after they're processed (mutually exclusive with `cursor_column`). |

Any other query parameter (e.g. `sslmode=disable`) is left on the connection
URL untouched and passed to the driver as-is.

## PostgreSQL CDC

A separate connector for streaming logical-replication changes (insert/
update/delete) instead of reading a table snapshot. Uses `postgres-cdc://`
(alias `pgcdc://`) to select the endpoint kind; the connection URL underneath
it is a plain Postgres URL.

```text
postgres-cdc://[user:pass@]host[:port]/database?publication=<name>&slot_name=<name>
```

In config, the key is `postgres_cdc`:

```yaml
input:
  postgres_cdc: { url: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/app", publication: "orders_pub", slot_name: "mqb_orders" }
```

**Stream changes from a publication into Kafka, continuous:**

```bash
mqb copy \
  --from 'postgres-cdc://user:pass@localhost/app?publication=mqb_pub&slot_name=mqb_slot' \
  --to kafka://kafka.local:9092?topic=app-changes
```

**Replicate a table into another PostgreSQL instance, continuous:**

```bash
mqb copy \
  --from 'postgres-cdc://user:pass@localhost/app?publication=mqb_pub&slot_name=mqb_slot' \
  --to 'postgres://user:pass@otherhost/replica?table=orders&auto_create_table=true'
```

`publication` must already exist on the source (`CREATE PUBLICATION mqb_pub
FOR TABLE orders;`); `slot_name` is created automatically if missing.

## Writing by column name

With `columns: auto` the sink reads the table's columns at start and builds the INSERT from each
record. It works on PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB and SQLite.

- **Matching.** A field goes into the column with the same name; if there is none, a name that
  differs only in case matches (`ID` → `id`). When a record has both spellings, the exact
  one is written and the other counts as a field without a column. Fields without a column are not written, and the
  first one is logged as a warning.
- **`extra_column`.** Names a column that takes those fields instead, as one JSON object:
  with `extra_column=extra`, `{"id":1,"color":"red"}` writes `id = 1` and
  `extra = {"color":"red"}`. A record with no such field leaves the column out. When a
  record fills the column itself with an object (or with JSON text holding one, as a SQL
  source delivers it), the collected fields are added to it and its own keys win. An upsert replaces the stored object; it does not merge into it.
- **Missing fields.** A column a record does not name is left out of the statement: on insert it
  gets its default, on update it keeps its value. An explicit `null` writes `NULL`.
- **Types.** On PostgreSQL every value is cast to the column's type, so a `numeric`,
  `timestamptz`, `uuid`, `jsonb` or enum column accepts the text a SQL source or a CSV file
  delivers, a JSON array goes into an array column, and `0`/`1` go into a `boolean`. A nested object or array is written as
  JSON text. A value the column cannot take fails the batch with the database's message.
- **`key`.** Generates `ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE` (PostgreSQL, SQLite) or
  `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` (MySQL/MariaDB). When one batch has several records with the same
  key, the last one wins.
- **`bulk_copy`** (PostgreSQL) works with `columns: auto`, but not together with `key`. A batch
  whose records name different columns is written in one transaction.
- **A record that cannot be mapped** — not a JSON object, or no field is a column — is rejected
  alone; the rest of the batch is written.

`columns` cannot be combined with `insert_query` or `auto_create_table`.
