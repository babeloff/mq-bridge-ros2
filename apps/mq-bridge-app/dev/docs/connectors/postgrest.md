# PostgREST and Supabase

PostgREST turns a Postgres table into a REST resource, and Supabase's data API
is PostgREST. The generic [`http_bulk`](./http-bulk.md) output writes to it:
an upsert is a POST of a JSON array, a delete is a filter on the primary key.
Tested against PostgREST 16.4. A hosted Supabase project has not been tried.

Use this when only the REST API is reachable. With a database connection, the
[Postgres](./postgres.md) output writes the same rows directly and faster.

```yaml
output:
  http_bulk:
    url: http://localhost:3000
    headers:
      Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates
    operation: "${metadata:postgres.operation}"
    upsert:
      path: /books
      format: json_array
    delete:
      method: DELETE
      path: /books?id=in.({ids})
```

For Supabase, the documented form is the project URL with `/rest/v1` before the
table, and the key in two headers:

```yaml
output:
  http_bulk:
    url: https://your-project.supabase.co
    headers:
      apikey: <key>
      Authorization: Bearer <key>
      Prefer: resolution=merge-duplicates
    upsert:
      path: /rest/v1/books
      format: json_array
    delete:
      method: DELETE
      path: /rest/v1/books?id=in.({ids})
```

## What to know

- **The table needs a primary key.** `resolution=merge-duplicates` updates the
  row with the same key; without the header a second write of a row fails.
- **A request is one transaction.** One row the table refuses, for example a
  text in an integer column, fails every row of that request with the database's
  message. A smaller `batch_size` narrows it down.
- **Every row of a request needs the same columns**, which is what a change
  stream of one table gives.
- **Row level security applies** to the role behind the key.

All fields and the behaviour on errors are on the [`http_bulk`](./http-bulk.md) page.
